## Angular 5 Data Table

[Angular 2 data table](https://github.com/ggmod/angular-2-data-table) updated for Angular 5. It looks the same as the [old demo](https://ggmod.github.io/angular-2-data-table-demo)

Run it with `ng serve -o` using the angular cli.
(Packaging it as an npm library proved to be impractical last time because of the many issues with reusable angular component libraries)
